                The legacy of his tribute is just as powerful today as Royal Salute continues
                to celebrate the extraordinary through momentous whiskies and the occasions that
                call for them to be enjoyed. And, though it remains steeped in tradition, it
                perfectcly balances modern needs by pushing the art of blending into new,
                creative and ambitious forms.
