            <p>
                A powerful, sophisticated and opulent blend, aged for a minimum of 21 years and
                housed in a classic Wade porcelain flagon, this scotch whisky is named for the
                tradition of the 21 Gun Salute that is fired at the Tower of London for Royal
                celebrations.
